Morse Code – pat2-subtask1

 Overview

Morse code is a method of encoding text characters as sequences of dots (`.`) and dashes (`-`). It is used to transmit messages using sound, light, or visual signals in telecommunication.

 Historical Context

Morse code was developed in the 1830s and 1840s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail. It was originally designed for use with the electric telegraph system, allowing long-distance communication before telephones existed. It became widely used in maritime and military communications.

How Morse Code Works

Each letter and number is represented by a unique combination of short signals (dots) and long signals (dashes). For example:
- **A** = `.−`
- **B** = `−...`
- **C** = `−.−.`

A brief pause separates individual letters, and a longer pause separates words.

Morse code can be transmitted via:
- **Sound**: short and long beeps
- **Light**: flashes of short or long duration
- **Radio**: on/off keying in CW (Continuous Wave) mode
